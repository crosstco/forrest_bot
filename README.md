## <center>Forrest Bot</center>

**Most Discord servers are messy, disorganized, and unrewarding to be a part of.**<br>Seriously, why do my personal friends and myself use 6 different barebones servers? How can I expect to build a community of my own if the server itself lacks any sort of oomph?
<br><br>
This is a personal Discord server project with a dedicated ~~dog~~ bot to help automate server processes and make it more fun to be a part of. The bot's development will be completely open source for those interested and my design process documented below. On completion of an MVP, I will put the public link to the server in this README as well.
<br><br>
Despite the casual context of this project, I will be treating this a true software engineering project and developing formal documentation covering the engineering design cycle of which I have experience with from my time at university.
<br><br>
They will all be put in a shared folder on Google Drive for those interested.
